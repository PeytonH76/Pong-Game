# Overview

I created a simple pong game so that I can learn more basics on game development.
I wanted to see if game development may be something that I could potentially enjoy.
In order to play game, you use the 'W' and 'S' key for the left paddle and the 'Up' and
'Down' key for the right paddle. Then you try to keep the ball from reaching your end zone.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

I used Jetbrains Rider to create my project in C#. I used Microsoft's XNA framework
which has classes for game development.  These classes include things for graphics, audio, user input, etc.

# Future Work

* Add music playing in the background.
* Add a loading and save function.
* Make the ball move faster after multiple hits.  It will stack up in speed over time.
